# raylib-build-template
Template repo to quickly get started with raylib development for **Desktop and Android without Android Studio**.  
Inspired by [gxbuild](https://github.com/gtrxAC/gxbuild).

## Setting up
1. In the toplevel `CMakeLists.txt`:
    - replace `projectname` with actual project name
    - replace `appname` with the actual app name.
1. Initialize and setup Raylib submodule:
    - Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
    - Checkout preferred Raylib version inside `external/raylib` directory.
1. Replace the `LICENSE` and `README.md` files as needed.

## Building for Desktop
Can simply build and run the project using cmake as normally done:
```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
build/appname
```

## Building for Android (Linux Only)
<!-- NOTE: There is no script included for building Android on Windows, however can use WSL. -->
1. Install Java using a package manager (make sure you get the **JDK**, not just JRE).  
1. Edit the variables that are at the top of the `android-build.sh`.  
1. To build the APK:
    ```sh
    ./android-build.sh
    ```
1. To build, install and run the APK (if any device or emulator is connected):
    ```sh
    ./android-build.sh -r
    ```

> NOTE: The APK generated by script `android-build.sh` should **only used for development purposes**.  
> **DO NOT use it as final APK** - signing, optimization, and alignment must be handled properly before production release.
